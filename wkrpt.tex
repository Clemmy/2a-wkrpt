	Ten Thousand Coffees is startup whose main product is a social networking platform directed towards connecting students with
	industry professionals. Employed as a member of the core development team for Ten Thousand Coffees, I worked on improving the site
	and starting experiments over the course of the term. One of the tasks that I was entrusted with was the addition of messaging functionality
	to Ten Thousand Coffee's online platform.
}
{
	From the the initial planning phase of the messaging system until now, there were several changes of requirements, as well as a limited
	budget for development. One of the fundamental decisions to make during planning phase was the database system to utilizes for this project.
	This report analyzes two database systems suitable for backing the messaging platform, and identifies the more
	appropriate alternative for the project.
