	Ten Thousand Coffees is startup whose main product is a social networking platform directed towards connecting students with industry professionals. Employed as a member of the core development team for Ten Thousand Coffees, I worked on improving the site and starting experiments over the course of the term. One of the tasks that I was entrusted with was the addition of messaging functionality to Ten Thousand Coffee's online platform.
}
{
	From the the initial planning phase of the messaging system until now, there were several changes of requirements, as well as a limited budget for development. One of the fundamental decisions to make during planning phase was the database system to utilizes for this project. This report analyzes two database systems suitable for backing the messaging platform, and identifies the more appropriate alternative for the project.

{
	I would like to thank my co-workers at Ten Thousand Coffees for their continuous guidance during my stay with them. Additionally, I would like to especially thank Elliott Garcea, the lead engineer at Ten Thousand Coffees, for his detailed discussion about our platform's design decisions with me. Finally, I would like to thank my friend, Raymond Wan, for answering a lot of questions that I have about relational database management systems.

\section{Introduction}
For several decades, the amount of technological startups has been growing and exploring a vast amount of business models to meet the needs of an ever-changing market. From dating sites to smart-watches, there is a business for almost every idea imaginable. Upon closer inspection of the aforementioned startups, there are noticeably many web applications which are primarily focused on messaging, or, at the very least, include a messaging component. To enable messaging capabilities in a web application, there needs to be a web-server to act as the communication bridge between different users, a database to persist user and message data onto for later usage, and a user interface to allow different people to interact with the web application and message other users. The database, in particular, is very important because it serves as a central store for writing and retrieving user generated content such as message content, chat history logs, and various other datasets for use by the application; without the database, a messaging application simply ceases to function.

However, this is where the startup aspect of Ten Thousand Coffees comes into play. Ten Thousand Coffees is a web application that enables users on the site to connect with one another and invite other parties for coffee chats. As a growing company striving to survive in a fierce environment, the importance of a flexible, scalable, and affordable solution is paramount. This is because startups are limited in budget, and have the need the for high growth. In order to have be successful, a startup must be efficient in using the resources that it can afford, and make decisions that enable them to scale both quickly, and affordably, so that they could outperform the competition. For the Ten Thousand Coffees platform, many technical decisions were made during the planning phase, and one such decision was to use MongoDB, a new, open-sourced NOSQL database that is based on a document object model that features horizontal scalability as well as a dynamic schema that allows for agile development. MongoDB was chosen over a traditional SQL database such as MySQL. In contrast, SQL databases have been around for much longer than NOSQL databases, and therefore have gained a lot of enterprise users. A SQL database such as MySQL and a NOSQL database such as MongoDB have completely different design principles, and this report will explore why Ten Thousand Coffees chose MongoDB over MySQL.
