	Ten Thousand Coffees is startup whose main product is a social networking platform directed towards connecting students with
	industry professionals. Employed as a member of the core development team for Ten Thousand Coffees, I worked on improving the site
	and starting experiments over the course of the term. One of the tasks that I was entrusted with was the addition of group messaging
	support to Ten Thousand Coffee's messaging service.
